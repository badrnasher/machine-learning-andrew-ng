# Machine Learning with Andrew Ng

Programming assignments that I implemented in python of [Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (it uses Octave/MATLAB). I also added some concepts and formulas that I think are useful to help to understand the algorithms.




### Programming Assignments Notebooks:

[Programming Exercise 1 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/badrnasher/machine-learning-andrew-ng/tree/main/w2_ex1-octave)
<br>
[Programming Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/badrnasher/machine-learning-andrew-ng/tree/main/w3_ex2-octave)
<br>
[Programming Exercise 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks](https://github.com/badrnasher/machine-learning-andrew-ng/tree/main/w4_ex3-octave)
